  https://betterprogramming.pub/calculating-pi-%CF%80-with-monte-carlo-using-parallel-computing-with-openmp-and-c-2b3a357f0f78

Options:
  --all                 Print out intermediate calculated values of PI.
  --sampleSize INT      Number of points to evaluate per computation of a
                        single value. (default: 100000)
  -i, --iterations INT  How many iterations should the computation be repeated
                        until the final value is reported. (default: 100)
  -h, --help            Show this message and exit
```
